def normalize(x):
    '''
    Apply normalization to a batch of feature vectors.
    
    Args:
        x: numpy array of shape (batch_size, features)
           Raw activations from a neural network layer
    
    Returns:
        numpy array of same shape (batch_size, features)
        Normalized activations
    
    Requirements:
        - Must not be the identity function
        - Must work on 2D arrays of any size
        - Must be deterministic
        - Must not produce NaN or Inf
        - Normalize across the LAST dimension (features)
    
    Hint: Modern LLMs use RMSNorm, which normalizes by the
    root mean square of the feature values. But you can
    implement any normalization you like!

    result = x/rms_norm  # Replace with your normalization
